        <h1 class="faqTitle">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
      <h1 class="subTitle">1. What are you doing?</h1>
      <p>I like to spend my time working with wood and resin. Most of my projects include both materials. I use different tools to sculpt and turn amazing wood in even more amazing hosehold decorations. In other words, I honor and preserv the wood we have left with the help of resin.</p>
      <h1 class="subTitle">2. Is this your full time job?</h1>
      <p>Unfortunatlly not. Hopefully in the close future I will be able to get more materails and time to create more stuff. For the moment I am working with different people on other projects, unrelated with wood working or resin.</p>
      <h1 class="subTitle">3. How long have you been doing this for?</h1>
      <p>It is close to one year since I started working on the projects. My passion for wood working and resin started with something close but different to what I am doing now. I started by making abstract paintings on canvas using acrylic paints and after many paintings I decided to give wood working a shot. I'm happy that I did and who know's where the future might lead us.</p>
      <h1 class="subTitle">4. How did you learn to do this?</h1>
      <p>Mostly from trial and error, and the internet. The internet is an amazing tool if used properly. It can help you with any needs and wants you might have. I first started by watching tutorials on Youtube and reading blogs and later I enrolled in a coarse where I had the chance to sit with other expereinced artists and learn from them to further impoved my skills (I have a certificate to back that up). If you're interested in starting too, you can find plenty of information on my website and I will make sure to link to other useful documents and videos.</p>
      <h1 class="subTitle">5. Can you make me something?</h1>
      <p>Technicaly, I can. The only limits I'm facing at the moment are the tools I own and the high price of transport. If you think there is something that you might be interested in, you can contact me and we will go from there.</p>
      <h1 class="subTitle">6. What tools are you using?</h1>
      <p>I have a whole page dedicated too all the tools and equipment I'm using and I try to update it as soon as I get something new or if I change my opinion on something based on the expereince I had with that tool.</p>
      <h1 class="subTitle">7. I still have a question. How do I contact you?</h1>
      <p>You can send me an email. Please keep in mind that everyone is able to send me emails and at times it gets hard to answer all of them. If I take too long to answer or I don't answer at all, please don't take offence. The shorter the email, the better. Also, you can send me a message on facebook (no spam please).</p>
